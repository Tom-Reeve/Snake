# Snake
My attempt at the classic Snake game

# To Do List
- Resizable Canvas
- Game Over Page
- Make Movement Smoother
- Is It Possible For the Snake to Run Along the Edge of the Map? (Or Am I Just Bad?)
- Stop Apples Spawning Under the Snake
- More Gamemodes (More Apples, Increased Speed, Moving Apples)
- Perfect AI
- Apple Counter (Rather than Length)
